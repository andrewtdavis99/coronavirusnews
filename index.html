            <h1>Check if you or your child has coronavirus symptoms</h1>
            <p>If you have any of the main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), you must stay at home (self-isolate) and
                get a test.<p>

                    <h2>Main symptoms</h2>
                    <h4>The main symptoms of coronavirus are:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need
                            to
                            measure your temperature)</li>
                        <li>a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more
                            coughing
                            episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)</li>
                        <li>a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you've noticed you cannot
                            smell or
                            taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>Most people with coronavirus have at least 1 of these symptoms.
                </p>

                <h2>What to do if you have symptoms</h2>
                <h4>If you have any of the main symptoms of coronavirus:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stay at home (self-isolate) – do not leave your home or have visitors. Anyone you live with, and
                        anyone in your support bubble, must also self-isolate.</li>
                    <li>Get a test – get a test to check if you have coronavirus as soon as possible. Anyone you live
                        with,
                        and anyone in your support bubble, should also get a test if they have symptoms.</li>

            <h1>Who's at higher risk from coronavirus</h1>
            <h3>Coronavirus (COVID-19) can make anyone seriously ill. But for some people, the risk is higher.</h3>

            <p>There are 2 levels of higher risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>high risk (clinically extremely vulnerable)</li>
                <li>moderate risk (clinically vulnerable)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Important</h4>
            <p>The lists below may not include everyone who's at higher risk from coronavirus and may change as we learn
                more about the virus.</p>

            <h2>People at high risk (clinically extremely vulnerable)</h2>
            <p>People at high risk from coronavirus include people who:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>have had an organ transplant</li>
                <li>are having chemotherapy or antibody treatment for cancer, including immunotherapy</li>
                <li>are having an intense course of radiotherapy (radical radiotherapy) for lung cancer</li>
                <li>are having targeted cancer treatments that can affect the immune system (such as protein kinase
                    inhibitors or PARP inhibitors)</li>
                <li>have a serious heart condition and are pregnant</li>
                <li>are taking medicine that makes them much more likely to get infections (such as high doses of
                    steroids or immunosuppressant medicine)</li>
                <li>have a condition that means they have a very high risk of getting infections (such as SCID or sickle
                    cell)</li>
                <li>have been told by a doctor they have a severe lung condition (such as cystic fibrosis, severe asthma
                    or severe COPD)</li>
                <li>have had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in the past 6 months, or are still taking
                    immunosuppressant medicine</li>
                <li>have blood or bone marrow cancer (such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>People at moderate risk (clinically vulnerable)</h2>
            <p>People at moderate risk from coronavirus include people who:</p>


            <ul>
                <li>are 70 or older</li>
                <li>have a lung condition that's not severe (such as asthma, COPD, emphysema or bronchitis)</li>
                <li>have heart disease (such as heart failure)</li>
                <li>have diabetes</li>
                <li>have chronic kidney disease</li>
                <li>are pregnant</li>
                <li>are very obese (a BMI of 40 or above)</li>
                <li>are taking medicine that can affect the immune system (such as low doses of steroids)</li>
                <li>have a condition that means they have a high risk of getting infections</li>
                <li>have a condition affecting the brain or nerves (such as Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease,
                    multiple sclerosis or cerebral palsy)</li>
                <li>have liver disease (such as hepatitis)</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>What to do if you're at moderate risk</h2>
            <p>If you're at moderate risk from coronavirus, you can go out to work (if you cannot work from home) and
                for things like getting food or exercising. But you should try to stay at home as much as possible.</p>

            <p>It's very important you follow the general advice on social distancing, including staying at least 2
                metres (3 steps) away from anyone you do not live with.</p>

            <h2>Other things that can affect your risk</h2>
            <p>A report by Public Health England found that other things might also mean you are more likely to get
                seriously ill from coronavirus.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>having certain jobs, such as nurse, taxi driver and security guard</li>
                <li>where in the country you live – the risk is higher in poorer areas</li>
                <li>living in a care home</li>
                <li>being from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background</li>
                <li>being a man</li>
                <li>your age – your risk increases as you get older</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Social distancing and changes to everyday life</h1>
            <h5>Advice about avoiding close contact with other people (social distancing), looking after your wellbeing
            </h5>
            <h2>Social distancing: what you need to do</h2>
            <p>To stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), you should avoid close contact with anyone you do not live
                with.</p>

            <p>This is called social distancing.</p>


            <h3>How to avoid spreading the infection</h3>
            <p>It's very important to do what you can to reduce the risk of you and other people getting ill with
                coronavirus.</p>

            <p>You can spread the virus even if you do not have symptoms.</p>

            <h3>Do</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>wash your hands as soon as you get home</li>
                <li>use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available</li>
                <li>wash your hands with soap and water often – do this for at least 20 seconds</li>
                <li>stay at least 2 metres (3 steps) away from anyone you do not live with (or anyone not in your
                    support bubble) when outside your home</li>
                <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze
                </li>
                <li>put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dont</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean</li>
            </ul>



            <h3>Face coverings</h3>

            <p>Wear something that covers your nose and mouth:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>on public transport</li>
                <li>when you go to hospital appointments or visit someone in hospital</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you can, also wear a face covering in other places when it's hard to stay away from people, such as in
                shops.</p>

            <p>Face coverings should not be worn by children under 3 and people who would find wearing them difficult
                (such as people with breathing difficulties).</p>
